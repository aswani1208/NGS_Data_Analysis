#### What is variant?

- Genetic variants are differences in the DNA sequences of individuals within a population.
- Genetic variations are changes at the nucleotide level, it can be single or more base changes, difference in the number of copies of DNA segments or even a partial/full chromosome.
- These variations cause diversity among individuals in genotype and phenotype.
- These genetic variations can be further interpreted based on their consequences on mRNA and protein level.

 Genetic variants can be

- Somatic: Somatic variants arise during an individual's lifetime in tissues other than germ cells and are not passed to subsequent generations.

- Germline: Germline variants occur in all cells including germ cells and inherited from parents or arise spontaneously as de novo.

#### Types of genetic variants

DNA variants 
   1. Nucleotide level:
         - Single nucleotide variants
         - Small indels : Insertions, Deletions, Substitutions
   2. Chromosomal level:
         - Aneuploidies
         - Structural variants : Transloactions, Repeats, Inversions
         - Copy number variants: Amplifications (gain), Deletions (loss)


- Small Indels: short insertion-deletions of nucleotides with in DNA sequence, typically ranges from 1-50 bases 

- SNV : Changes at a single nucleotide within DNA sequence, it can be substitution ( Replacement of one nucleotide with another), deletion (Removal of single nucleotide) and insertion (Addition of a single nucleotide)

- Aneuploidy: Abnormality in the number of chromosomes 

- Large structutal variants: Alteration that cause changes in the structure, orgnaisation or arrangement of larger DNA segments.

    a. Inversions: Genetic rearrangement where a segment of DNA is reversed in orientation within the chromosome with two breakpoints.

    b. Translocation: Rearrangement of genetic material between non-homologous chromosomes

    c. Repeat expansions: Increase in the number of repeating DNA sequence within a gene.

- Copy number variations (CNV): Genetic alteration that involve the duplication or deletion of segments of DNA (>50 bases), resulting in changes in copy number of specific regions of the genome.

   a. Amplification: increase in the number of copies of a specific genetic sequence within the DNA. 

   b. Deletion: Loss of a portion of a DNA segment, resulting in fewer copies of specific genetic sequence.
