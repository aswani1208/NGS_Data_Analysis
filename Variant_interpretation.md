#### What is variant?

- Genetic variants are differences in the DNA sequences of individuals within a population.
- Genetic variations are changes at the nucleotide level, it can be single or more base changes, difference in the number of copies of DNA segments or even a partial/full chromosome.
- These variations cause diversity among individuals in genotype and phenotype.
- These genetic variations can be further interpreted based on their consequences on mRNA and protein level.

#### Types of genetic variants

- Somatic: Somatic variants arise during an individual's lifetime in tissues other than germ cells and are not passed to subsequent generations.

- Germline: Germline variants occur in all cells including germ cells and inherited from parents or arise spontaneously as de novo.
